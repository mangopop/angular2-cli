RXJS

The benefits
- observables are values or arrays of events
- they can be synchronous or asynchronous
- you subscribe to subject or observables
- the benefit of this is they wait for things to happen like promises but they are more powerful  
- pure functions are less prone to errors
- data is pushed instead of pulled (i.e promises)
    - a function returns one value when asked, obs can sync/async return zero to infinate from time invoked to onwards
- Observables can "return" multiple values over time (sync/async), unlike functions (sync)

terminology
- Subscribing to an Observable is analogous to calling a Function.
- Subject: is the equivalent to an EventEmitter, and the only way of multicasting a value or event to multiple Observers.
    - plain Observables are unicast

So how to use in the todo app?
