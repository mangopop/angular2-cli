New angular 2 app
Build a todo app

(if I get stuck https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/gh-pages/examples/angular2/app)

- A list with input
- when press enter item is added below
- items can also be deleted
- items can be ticked off as complete (goes grey with strike though)
- can do this by click and change class but also need to hold state for filtering
- items can be filtered by, all, active and completed
- surely ngif is used. Can use completed, but only when a one of the filters is active
- there is a count of active items
- items can be selected with radio button
- all items can be selected
- there is a clear completed button


Stretch objectives!
- Will all need to be persisted!
- Extract items into TodoStore
- Test!

RXJS style
- what events can we use this for 
    - add / remove / complete?
